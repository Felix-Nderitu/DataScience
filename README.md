Let us dive into getting started in data science and concept techniques 
**NB**// This guide is developed from my experience and several research guides, I saw what was repeated in several articles and videos at the time of writing I am a student in the data science world with some skills in programming 
I am assuming you have 
  - An understanding of Python programming  if not I'll indicate some resources (books to get you started with and probably also include some tasks, try to solve)

Let's get started:
